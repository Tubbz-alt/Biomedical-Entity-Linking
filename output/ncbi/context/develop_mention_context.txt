8675707	coronary heart disease	the relative risk rr of was one
8675707	coronary heart disease	05 after adjustment for risk factors the rr was one
8675707	coronary heart disease	increased in men with mutations was primarily observed for hdl chol 41 60 mg dl for hdl chol 60 mg dl men with and without mutations had low chd prevalence

8808606	myotonic dystrophy	analysis of meiotic segregation using single sperm typing meiotic drive at the locus
8808606	myotonic dystrophy	meiotic drive at the dm locus has recently been suggested as being responsible for maintaining the frequency in the human population of dm chromosomes capable of expansion to the disease state
8808606	dm	meiotic drive at the myotonic dystrophy locus has recently been suggested as being responsible for maintaining the frequency in the human population of dm chromosomes capable of expansion to the disease state
8808606	dm	meiotic drive at the myotonic dystrophy dm locus has recently been suggested as being responsible for maintaining the frequency in the human population of chromosomes capable of expansion to the disease state
8808606	dm	in order to test this hypothesis we have studied samples of single sperm from three individuals heterozygous at the locus each with one allele larger and one allele smaller than nineteen ctg repeats
8808606	dm	to guard against the possible problem of differential pcr amplification rates based on the lengths of the alleles the sperm were also typed at another closely linked marker whose allele size was unrelated to the allele size at the locus
8808606	myotonic dystrophy	this suggests that any greater amount of segregation distortion at the locus must result from events following sperm ejaculation
