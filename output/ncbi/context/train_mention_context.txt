10364521	fragile x syndrome	identification of the fmr one gene and the repeat amplification mechanism causing led to development of reliable dna based diagnostic methods including southern blot hybridization and pcr
10364521	fragile x syndrome	using an immunocytochemical technique on blood smears we recently developed a novel test for identification of patients with this method also called antibody test uses monoclonal antibodies against the fmr one gene product fmrp and is based on absence of fmrp in patients cells
10364521	fragile x syndrome	here we describe a new diagnostic test to identify male patients with on the basis of lack of fmrp in their hair roots
10364521	fragile x	expression of fmrp in hair roots was studied by use of an fmrp specific antibody test and the percentage of fmrp expressing hair roots in controls and in male patients was determined
10364521	fragile x	control individuals showed clear expression of fmrp in nearly every hair root whereas male patients lacked expression of fmrp in almost all their hair roots
10364521	mentally retarded	female patients with a full mutation showed fmrp expression in only some of their hair roots 55 and no overlap with normal female controls was observed
10364521	mentally retarded	the advantages of this test are one plucking of hair follicles does no appreciable harm to the patient two hairs can be sent in a simple envelope to a diagnostic center and three the result of the test is available within five h of plucking
10364521	fragile x	in addition this test enabled us to identify two patients who did not show the full mutation by analysis of dna isolated from blood cells

10072428	colorectal cancer	germline e cadherin gene cdh one mutations predispose to familial gastric cancer and
10072428	familial gastric cancer	inherited mutations in the e cadherin gene cdh one were described recently in three maori kindreds with familial gastric cancer is genetically heterogeneous and it is not clear what proportion of gastric cancer susceptibility in non maori populations is due to germline cdh one mutations
